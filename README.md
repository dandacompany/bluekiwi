## What is BlueKiwi?

BlueKiwi is a **self-hosted workflow engine for AI coding agents**. You design multi-step workflows once in the web UI, then any connected agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, …) can start and execute them — with every step logged in a live timeline you can watch in the browser.

```
You type:  /bk-start "backend code review"

Agent ──▶ BlueKiwi MCP ──▶ BlueKiwi Server ──▶ Web UI (live timeline)
          list_workflows      stores logs          your browser
          start_workflow      enforces RBAC        comments / approvals
          execute_step        saves outputs
          advance
```

**No more copy-pasting prompts.** Your best agent workflows become reusable institutional knowledge.

---

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose

### 1. Download the compose file

```bash
mkdir bluekiwi && cd bluekiwi
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandacompany/bluekiwi/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandacompany/bluekiwi/main/.env.example -o .env
```

### 2. Configure `.env`

Open `.env` and set the two required values:

```bash
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 16
DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_password

# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### 3. Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:3100/setup** → create your superuser account. The `/setup` page is only available until the first account is created.

> The stack runs the Next.js app on port `3100` (configurable via `APP_PORT`), PostgreSQL 16, and Redis 7 — all managed by Docker.

### 4. Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g bluekiwi
```

**Option A — accept an invite (recommended for new team members)**

Create an invite in **Settings → Team**, then:

```bash
bluekiwi accept <token> --server http://localhost:3100
```

Validates the invite → creates your account → issues an API key → detects installed agent runtimes → injects the BlueKiwi MCP server + skills into each one.

**Option B — init with an existing API key (superuser / admin)**

If you already have an account (e.g. the superuser created via `/setup`), generate a key in **Settings → API Keys**, then:

```bash
bluekiwi init --server http://localhost:3100 --api-key bk_xxxx
```

Connects to the server with the given key → detects installed runtimes → injects the MCP server + skills into each one.

---

## Quick Start Local Runtime (Beta)

If you want to try BlueKiwi without Docker, PostgreSQL, or Redis, the CLI can also run a local Quick Start runtime backed by SQLite.

Current stability level: `Beta`.

```bash
npm install -g bluekiwi
bluekiwi start
bluekiwi status
bluekiwi stop
```

What this mode does:

- runs BlueKiwi as a local process
- stores data in a local SQLite file
- auto-selects a free port starting from `3102`
- manages lifecycle through the CLI

This mode is intended for local authoring, demos, CI smoke validation, and small-scale testing. It is not positioned as full hosted/server parity yet. For team deployment and full hosted parity, use the Docker-based setup above.

---

## Skills

After `bluekiwi accept`, you have these slash commands inside Claude Code (and other supported runtimes):

| Command                | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/bk-start [workflow]` | Start or resume a workflow. Handles session restore, timed-out tasks, and HITL gates inline. |
| `/bk-design [goal]`    | Design and register a new workflow from a natural-language description.                      |
| `/bk-approve`          | Approve a paused HITL step when resuming a session mid-approval.                             |
| `/bk-improve`          | Analyze a completed task and suggest workflow improvements.                                  |
| `/bk-report`           | Generate a structured report for a completed task.                                           |
| `/bk-instruction`      | Create or update an instruction template in the library.                                     |
| `/bk-rewind`           | Rewind the current task to a previous step.                                                  |
| `/bk-status`           | Show current task progress and step details.                                                 |
| `/bk-version`          | Show or switch the active workflow version.                                                  |
| `/bk-credential`       | List or create credentials available to the agent.                                           |
| `/bk-scan`             | Run compliance pattern scans on the local repository.                                        |
| `/bk-share`            | Share a folder with a user group.                                                            |

**Example session:**

```
You:   /bk-start "backend code review"

Agent: → Starting "Backend Code Review" (6 steps)
         Step 1/6 — Summarize scope
         [executes ...]
         Step 2/6 — Security check
         ⏸  Gate: Review findings and approve to continue.
         [waits for human]

You:   /bk-approve

Agent: → Approved. Step 3/6 — Performance analysis ...
```

While the agent runs, watch the live timeline at **`http://localhost:3100/tasks/{id}`**.

## Workflow Builder

Open the web UI → **Workflows → New** → add steps.

### Node types

| Type       | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Action** | Agent executes autonomously and advances automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Gate**   | Agent pauses and waits for the next `/bk-start` call or human signal to continue. Enable **Visual Selection** to render a click-based HTML UI (bk-options, bk-checklist, bk-slider, …) that the agent writes and the user interacts with in a popup dialog. |
| **Loop**   | Agent repeats the step until a condition is met, then jumps forward.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)

Mark any **Action** node as `hitl=true` to require explicit human approval before the agent can advance. The agent calls `request_approval` and stops; a human reviews the output in the web UI and clicks **Approve**.

### Task lifecycle

```
pending → running → completed
                  → failed
                  → timed_out   (inactive for 2+ hours; /bk-start offers resume)
```

Tasks can be **rewound** to any previous step from the web UI or via `/bk-rewind`.

| Platform         | Template                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Railway          | `deploy/railway.json`          |
| Fly.io           | `deploy/fly.toml`              |
| Render           | `deploy/render.yaml`           |
| DigitalOcean App | `deploy/digitalocean-app.yaml` |
| Dokku            | `deploy/dokku/`                |

### Database migrations

The app runs migrations automatically on startup. For a fresh install, Docker loads `docker/init.sql` which creates the complete schema and marks the initial migration as applied — no manual steps needed.

To run migrations manually (e.g., in a CI pipeline):

```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate.ts
```

### Upgrading

Pull the new image and restart:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Migrations run automatically on the next app start.

## Security & RBAC

- **4-tier roles**: `superuser` → `admin` → `editor` → `viewer`
- **API keys**: `bk_` prefix, SHA-256 hashed, with expiry and revocation
- **Folders**: personal / group / public visibility with 2-level hierarchy
- **Sharing**: grant groups `reader` or `contributor` access to specific folders
- **No default credentials** — the superuser account is created on first visit to `/setup`
- **MCP has no direct DB access** — all calls go through the authenticated REST API
